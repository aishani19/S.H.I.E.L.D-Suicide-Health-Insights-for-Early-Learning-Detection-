Suicide Health Insights for Early Learning and Detection is a data science and machine learning project focused on understanding and predicting suicide trends across different ages, countries, years, and generations. The project analyzes global suicide data to uncover meaningful patterns that can support early detection, awareness, and prevention strategies.

By applying statistical analysis and predictive modeling, the system identifies correlations between demographic factors and suicide rates, helping policymakers, researchers, and mental health organizations make data-informed decisions.

This project aims to:

📊 Analyze how age groups, countries, years, and generations influence suicide rates.

🤖 Build a machine learning model that predicts suicide trends based on demographic data.

🌍 Visualize global and generational suicide patterns to highlight areas needing awareness and intervention.

💡 Support early learning and detection through data-driven insights for mental health improvement.

Ultimately, this project demonstrates how data science can contribute to saving lives by recognizing risk factors and promoting proactive mental health care worldwide.
